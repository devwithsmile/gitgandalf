I will be using this file to test the pre-commit hook.

pre-commit file content so far : 
#!/bin/sh

DIFF=$(git diff --cached)

if [ -z "$DIFF" ]; then
    exit 0
fi

echo "$DIFF" | node gitgandalf.js

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Git Gandalf review failed"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Git Gandalf review in progress"
exit 0
